#### tabascoblog post day 2

> I think I got enough down to work this well now :)

Welcome back! Didn't think I'd see you all again so soon, but here we are. I don't think there's much to say again today, but I did have some fun walking around town today, and saw a movie too! The new hunger games one of course. While I'm not the biggest fanboy of the series, I do really love the concept and how its executed, as well as the overall vibes and continuity of the new movie, it really sets things into perspective and adds to the world really well. My favorite character was the headmaster of the games, she was SO cool, even though she was a bit of a villain.

Anyways, I'm having fun stressing over moving from my flat, hope you all are having fun relaxing on holidays. :)

Keep it hot, keep it spicy, and keep in tune for the future  

Stay spicy - **Tabasco**
