#### tabascoblog Day 4 I think  

> Sorry for the break yesterday I'm like so tired.  

Hey everyone! I'm back lol. I've been so busy with work training, which is lots but so satisfying being a full chef now. Also now I'm single but anyways thats for another day. lol. OH YEA STORY TIME. So at work we were just getting orders like normal, Chicken burgers, beef burgers, fries, etc, and an order came through starting normal like one chowder, a donut burger AND THEN THERE WERE TWO BEEF BURGERS ONE MEDIUM RARE AND ONE RARE. LIKE COME ON THEY'RE BEEF PATTIES.  We're not that rich of a business we'd put full steaks on burgers. anyways that made my day. Hope ya'll stick around, big things coming soon.  

this is line 12 or smthn idk  

Keep it hot, keep it spicy, and keep in tune for the future  

Stay spicy - **Tabasco**
